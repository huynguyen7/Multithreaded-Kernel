## Summary
- Crytography is both the _lock(method)_ and the _combination(key)_ that protects a secret message from anyone who doesnâ€™t know the key.
- Importantly, people can have the same lock(method), personal data can still be secured because  their _individual cryptographic keys_ are different. The important concept is that anyone can have the cryptographic method, You may share many secrets, but all your secrets are built on the fact that you and your confidant share a secret key.
